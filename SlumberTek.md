# Explanation of the User Interface (UI) entities of the SlumberTek

### To make SlumberTek smarter over time, **your device shares anonymous data with ASC**. Want to opt out or won‚Äôt be using internet? Just switch off ‚ÄúSend Data to ASC‚Äù below, no hard feelings üòÅ!

## User Interface Overview (version 0.3.0)

(SlumberTek has long UI entity names and will not be fully visible, you will need to hover your mouse over your entities to see their full names.) 

## You can watch a video about the Home Assistant Overview elements here (new 0.3.0 UI not yet added to video):

### The UI has five entities **"Calibration"**, **"Transition to Off Delay"**, **"Transition to On Delay"**, **"Bed Sensor"**, **Calibration Status**.

### Calibration (turn on, lay on bed for at least 30s, get out of bed, turn off)
This helps set the pressure thresholds for your bed the first time you use the sensor, or as a reset if you make a significant change to your bed set up. To calibration, make sure your device is placed under your mattress at chest level, toggle the calibration switch on, lay on the bed for at least 30s, get out of the bed, toggle the switch off and you're done!

### Transition to Off Delay
This is the delay before the sensor sends an "off" signal to Home Assistant. I suggest this value be at least a 2-3 seconds, as big motions during the night have a chance of triggering a false "off" signal.

### Transition to On Delay
This is the delay before the sensor sends an "on" signal to Home Assistant. Typically this value can safely be 1-2 seconds without worrying about false "on" signals.

### Bed Sensor
Binary occupancy sensor that says when someone is in bed (occupied) or not (clear).

### Calibration Status
Text entity to explain your current auto-calibration status, it will give info about whether auto-calibration is active and when your next auto-calibration is.

## Diagnostic UI entities (only visible if you go into the ESPHome device settings)

(Default Home Assistant view cuts off full names, hover your mouse over your entities to see their full names.)

### There are twenty Diagnostic entities:

### Auto-calibration interval (0 is off)
This sets the number of hours between automatic calibration events, from 0 to 24 hours. If set to 0, auto-calibration is turned off, and the "Empty Bed value" and "Full Bed value" will remain fixed. If set above 0, auto-calibration will trigger every X hours and update the "Empty Bed value" and "Full Bed value" based on the previous 24 hours of "Pressure Voltage" data collected. Auto-calibration exists to help overcome slow daily and weekly changes in "Pressure Voltage" from temperature, humidity, and textile relaxation.

### Auto-calibration Midpoint adjuster (shifts Midpoint up and down)
Auto-calibration calculates the "Midpoint Estimate" between the maximum and minimum value of the "Pressure Voltage" measurements over the last 24 hours. 50% would set the "Midpoint Estimate" to be exactly between the maximum and minimum "Pressure Voltage" measures, 5% would set it to very close to the minimum value of "Pressure Voltage", 100% would be the maximum value of "Pressure Voltage" measures. Default is 30%, "Empty Bed value" and "Full bed value" shift up or down with this value. 

### Auto-calibration trigger sensitivity (How much the last 24hr Pressure Voltage range must be over the current Full-Empty bed threshold gap to trigger auto-calibration)
Auto-calibration only changes the calibration if difference between the maximum and minimum "Pressure Voltage" over the last 24 hours is greater than this sliders percentage of the gap between "Empty Bed value" and "Full Bed value". This helps keep your calibration stable if you don't use your bed for a few nights you may want to increase this if you have a heavy pet that likes to sleep on your bed during the day.

### Dynamic Empty Bed Threshold
If the "Pressure Voltage" signal goes *above* this value it will start the "Transition to Off Delay" timer to trigger "clear" for the "Bed Sensor". 

### Dynamic Full Bed Threshold
If the "Pressure Voltage" signal goes *below* this value it will start the "Transition to On Delay" timer to trigger "occupied" for the "Bed Sensor". 

### Empty Bed Detection Sensitivity (0 turns off dynamic threshold, higher is more sensitive)
Increasing this brings this value bring your "Dynamic Empty Bed Threshold" to your current "Pressure Voltage" value, making your SlumberTek more likely to trigger "clear" events when you first start getting out of bed. Too high of a value will greatly increase false "clear" events from night motion. Default value is 0, increase this value if your SlumberTek is slow to trigger when you get out of bed.

### Empty Bed threshold adjuster (percentage distance from auto-calibration Midpoint Estimate)
Change this to adjust your "Empty Bed value" relative to the daily auto-calibrated "Midpoint Estimate". 50% is halfway between your "Midpoint Estimate" and the maximum value of your "Pressure Voltage" during the auto-calibration. Default is 30%, increasing this value can help reduce false "clear" events from night motion.

### Detection Sensitivity (lower is more sensitive)
Lower values help to trigger events quicker. When "Increased out of bed sensitivity mode" is *off* this value is only applied to getting into bed events ("on"). When "Increased out of bed sensitivity mode" is on, the default is increased to 6 to this applies to both the "on" and "off" events. 

Increasing "Empty Bed Detection Sensitivity" brings this value closer to your current "Pressure Voltage" value.it more likely to trigger "clear" events when you first start getting out of bed, it may also increase false "clear" events from large night motion.


### Empty Bed value
This is the upper limit for the Dynamic Empty/Full Bed threshold. You may tweak this threshold manually, and the automatic threshold will use your new value as a starting point for the next update. This value is automatically adjusted every 8 hours based on the previous 24 hours data to keep the sensor more accurate across days.

### Increased out of bed sensitivity mode
This switch helps with bed setups that struggle to recover quickly in the morning to trigger "off" events. Typically this is helpful for people with slat frames. Note: This option can *increase false off events*, increase the detection sensitivity slider to tune your bed setup if needed.

### Full Bed value
If your "Pressure Voltage" ever goes below this value, your device will trigger to "detected".

### Internal Temperature
The temperature of the CPU.

### Pressure Voltage
This is the raw signal from the SlumberTek sensor. All logic and "Bed Sensor" decisions are made from the changes of this value.

### Reset Counter
This helps keep track of how often the device is restarting if there is a firmware issue.

### Send Data to ASC (If you run no internet HA turn this off)
This setting is on by default, and is immensely helpful in identifying ways to improve firmware and software! If your Home Assistant is connected to the internet, this option anonymously sends encrypted MQTT posts to ASC's private servers. The data is labeled using your ESPHome ${name}, not your ${friendly_name}, which is defaultly slumbertek-XXXXXX (XXXXXX is the last 6 digits of your device's MAC address). ASC does not know your device's mac address and there is no way for us to identify your user data. If you have any questions about this please reach out directly to hello@asc.com. 

### Threshold Convergence Factor
This setting expands (higher numbers) or contracts (lower numbers) the "Empty Bed" and "Full Bed" thresholds. The default value is (7), increase the number to (8) or (9) if you're having trouble with timely "off" events. Alternatively, if you're having trouble with false "off" events then decrease the value to (6) or (5).

### Update rate (0 is off)
"Pressure Voltage", "Dynamic Empty Bed Threshold", and "Dynamic Full Bed Threshold" are updated to Home Assistant at a rate defined by this setting. The default is an update every 1 second and can be increased to an update every 300 seconds (5 mins). These values are only updated if they have changed since the last update.

### WiFi Signal Strength
WiFi connection strength to your device, values higher than -60dB indicate a weak WiFi signal.
